# Convert string to number

In file `getnum.c` add a function body that converts the supplied string into a
number and checks for errors.  No other include should be needed, you only need
to adjust the function body.  More information in the function comment itself.

Hints:
- The function shouldn't be more than 10 lines long.
- It's enough to have 6 code lines in the function.
