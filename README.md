# Exercises (for fun and profit)

Here are some simplest exercises that can be given out for others to try and
complete.

## List:
- `numtest` -- simplest one, just convert string to number and check for errors
- `thread_sync` -- multithreaded basics, use mutual execution for effective
  thread synchronization

## Contributions
Do not submit pull requests for solutions, they should be done by those who
receive the exercises.  Other than that, any contributions are welcome.
